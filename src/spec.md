# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Experience” and “Projects completed” stats from the homepage hero section.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the hero metrics that show “Experience” and “Projects completed” (including their numeric values) so they are not displayed anywhere in the hero.
- Adjust hero layout/styling after removal to ensure the section remains visually balanced on mobile and desktop without empty gaps or misalignment.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage hero no longer shows “Experience” or “Completed/Projects completed” stats, and the hero layout remains clean and well-aligned across screen sizes.
