# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site branding to “Wed Shilpi” and remove specific content elements (pricing FAQ content, photography partner mentions, and social icons).

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-facing occurrences of the brand name “aurora” with “Wed Shilpi” (including header/footer branding text, relevant image alt text, and copyright text where applicable).
- Remove the pricing-related FAQ item (“How much does a website cost?”) and ensure no remaining FAQ answers include pricing figures/ranges.
- Remove mentions of professional photography partners from site content, including updating the content/images FAQ answer to stay coherent in English.
- Remove social media icons/links for Facebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn from the site (including the footer icon row).

**User-visible outcome:** The website consistently displays the “Wed Shilpi” brand name, the FAQ no longer includes pricing content or photography partner mentions, and social media icons/links for Facebook/Instagram/X/LinkedIn are no longer shown.
